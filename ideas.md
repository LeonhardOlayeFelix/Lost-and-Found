# IDEAS FOR PROJECT

## Supermarket Stock finder
Show which local supermarkets a user can find a given item in stock (w prices etc) 

### Main points:
 - ask local supermarkets for stock inventory login
 - parse that data send it to students etc.

### Pros:
 - v cool idea, would be super useful and obvs involves lotta data handling

### Cons:
 - supermarkets might not let us have access :(


## MMO club penguin style
club penguin/bin weevils/moshi monsters style game

### Main points:
 - we have a room per player (big database vibes icl) + friends + pets/furniture etc

### Pros:
 - Nostalgia (I miss the innocence of youth)

### Cons:
 - Lots of images/models n shit need to be created which isn't super cs-y


## Sleep comparison
Sleep data for users is uploaded and cohort can compare their sleep to others

### Main Points:
- Users would be able to see te average sleep time for specific cohorts of users, such as successful students etc
- Could also be used to see how tired people will be for tomorrow's lecture etc

### Pros:
- Somewhat useful and pretty novel
 
### Cons:
- Very hard to get reliable data (especially if we want it to be recent - such as for usage the next day)
- Limited scope and options for extending the project
- Some ethical concerns about advising sleep practices e.g. if the average A student goes to bed a 3am should we advertise that?


## Shared Timetable scheduler:
Students' shared calender which helps people find timeslots where their friends are all available

**May have already been done in a previous project so will need to investigate how we can do it** 
 

### Main points:
- Group calendar where student's upload their calendars (mostly university calendar but extends to personal too) and then can co-ordinate when they are free
- Project would recommend timings to schedule events (not just when both are free but perhaps take into consideration early mornings etc)


### Pros:
- Algorithmically complex/interesting, lots of opportunity to flex computer skillz 
- Genuinely very useful 
- Some interesting ethics about data privacy etc which we will need to consider and write about in report 
- largely extendable (such as with scheduling for collections of people - like societies and groups)

### Cons:
- Not particularly novel idea
- May be difficult to get calendar data from users
- Base app might be too narrow as it is only a single feature of scheduling for multiple users
